****According to PAD what are the tips that make software developers careful?****

Answer: 
- The tip “Share code only when ready.”

  Never check in code that’s not ready for others. Deliberately checking in code that doesn’t compile or pass its unit tests should be considered an act of criminal project negligence.

- The tip “Review all code.”

  Code reviews are invaluable in improving the quality of the code and keeping the error rate low. If done correctly, reviews can be practical and effective. Review code after each task, using different developers.

****Q4: How can conflict in git be resolved?****

Answer: To resolve the conflict in git, edit the files to fix the conflicting changes and then add the resolved files by running git add. After that, to commit the repaired merge, run git commit. Git remembers that you are in the middle of a merge, so it sets the parents of the commit correctly.

****Q5: What is git rebase and how can it be used to resolve conflicts in a feature branch before merge?****

Answer: git rebase allows one to move the first commit of a branch to a new starting location. The command effectively will replay the changes made in the feature branch at the tip of master, allowing conflicts to be resolved in the process. When done with care, this will allow the feature branch to be merged into master with relative ease and sometimes as a simple fast-forward operation.
